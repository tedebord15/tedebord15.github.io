<h1>â€œHistory is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction." (Bill Watterson 1958-present)</h1>

<p>Bill Watterson was born on July 5, 1958, in Washington, D.C. While attending Kenyon College, Watterson drew cartoons for the college paper, leading to a position at the Cincinnati Post. Watterson wanted to draw comic strips and began trying to syndicate his original creation, "Calvin and Hobbes," a cartoon about a rambunctious boy and his imaginary toy tiger friend that went on to garner wide fame. </p>
